Development notes of A Primer for SysML (Thai language)

Vorachet Jaroensawas



When the reader finishes reading my book, What will they have gained ?

Ans:

1) Saved time to learn SysML with a pocket book size (<= 250 pages).
2) Learned an alternative method to model systems using SysML
3) Provided well background (brief history will be discussed),
   concept (yes), and example (a must)

** I am still thinking about the diagrams in the book.
   Diagram drawed by a simple diagram software edtior would be the choice

What makes my content different than the other SysML books out there?

Ans:

1) The book will be written in Thai language.
2) The book will teach the reader to model a simple system.
   It should be a complete model of a small system, so the read could see how to
   desribe system in many aspect using SysML feature.
