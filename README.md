Development notes of A Primer for SysML (Thai language)

Vorachet Jaroensawas



When the reader finishes reading my book, What will they have gained ?

Ans:

1) Saved time to learn SysML with the size of pocket book (<= 250 pages).
2) Learned an alternative method to model systems using SysML
3) Provided background (brief history will be discussed),
   concept (++), and examples (+++)

** I am still think of the SysML diagrams used in the book.
   Simply use a simple diagram edtior would be the choice

What makes my content different than the other SysML books out there?

Ans:

1) The book will be written in Thai language.
2) Book format - Example, Situation, Objective, Action ,and Review
